          Snoopy is upset about the way that Polly is
          behaving.  It is as if whenever anyone asks
          Polly to talk, Polly will be nasty.  Maybe if
          instead of Snoopy barking at Polly when he
          wants Polly to talk, Snoopy quietly asks Polly
          to be pleasant for a change, things would go
          better.  Now maybe Snoopy barking quietly will
          not make Polly nasty.'.
