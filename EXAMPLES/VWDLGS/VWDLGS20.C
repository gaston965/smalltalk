   FUNCTION: LibMain(HANDLE, WORD, WORD, LPSTR)

   PURPOSE:  Is called by LibEntry.  LibEntry is called by Windows when
             the DLL is loaded.  The LibEntry routine is provided in
             the LIBENTRY.OBJ in the SDK Link Libraries disk.  (The
             source LIBENTRY.ASM is also provided.)

/****************************************************************************
    FUNCTION:  WEP(int)

    PURPOSE:  Performs cleanup tasks when the DLL is unloaded.  WEP() is
              called automatically by Windows when the DLL is unloaded (no
              remaining tasks still have the DLL loaded).  It is strongly
              recommended that a DLL have a WEP() function, even if it does
              nothing but returns success (1), as in this example.
