The list below shows the files used to create 
dialog only DLL (vwdlgs.dll) used in Smalltalk.
(Microsoft C 6.0 and Windows SDK is required to
make a resource only DLL).

    vwdlgs         - make file for vwdlgs.dll
    vwdlgs.c      - c file for vwdlgs.dll that contains WEP
    vwdlgs.def   - definition file for vwdlgs.dll 
                            (Used by the Linker)
    vwdlgs.rc    - resource file for vwdlgs.dll 
                            (Used by Resource Compiler)
    vwdlgs.dlg   - dialog file for vwdlgs.dll 
                            (Used by Dialog Editor)

To create your own dialog only DLL, rename the 
vwdlgs.*  to a new name  (Don't just add a new dialog
template to vwdlgs.dll).  Remember to change 
references to your new file name in vwdlgs. and 
vwdlgs.rc files.  Also remember to change the 
"LIBRARY" statement in vwdlgs.def to reflect
the new library name.

To add dialog templates either manually edit your
.dlg file or use the dialog editor.   Make sure to delete 
unneeded dialog templates  (the ones that came with
the original vwdlgs.dlg).

To open a dialog box from Smalltalk apply the 
following method to an instance of Dialog Box.

    self fromDLLFile: 'your.dll' templateName: 'YourDialogTemplate'.

Make sure your DLL is in your path and don't forget to 
put the '.dll' extension.

Look at NewSubclassDialog class for example.
