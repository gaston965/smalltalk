                                If necessary, a dialog box prompts the

    Write Icon To Module : Writes the icon to the module
                                (DLL or EXE) from which the icon has been
                                loaded. If this is a Smalltalk/V
                                executable file,  This changes the icon 
                                of the executable as well as the window.
                                (During startup, if Smalltalk detects that
                                it's running a runtime version, then it
                                replaces the class icon with the icon 
                                in the exe.)
