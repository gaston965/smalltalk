IncomeTax
------------------

This file contains a brief description of IncomeTax 
application.  IncomeTax application is an example 
of creating a dialog box that appears to have a 
menu bar in Smalltalk.   It only appear that the 
dialog box has a menu bar.  Actually, IncomeTax 
is a ViewManager subclass that has a dialog box 
as a subpane.  So IncomeTax is a window that
has a menu bar that also contains a dialog box
(without border) as a subpane.  IncomeTax also 
demonstrates the use of the following:

    - Creating a Modeless DialogBox.
        (Modeless DialogBox does not disable 
            the parent window).

    - Changing the font of the controls.

    - Use of FormattedEntryFields.
        (Date, social security and currency field 
         only accept numbers and their
         output is formated.)

    - Use of FormattedStaticText.
        (currency field's output is formated.)

    - Customizing FormattedEntryFields.
        (Look at how social security entry field is created
            in #open.)

    - Use of #textChanged event to trigger an action.
        (In the income section the total income is 
            calculated automatically).

IncomeTax application shows one possible 
implementation of a large form entry application. 
This implementation divides the tasks into 
three screens.  The user navigates between
screens by using the 'Next' and 'Prev' buttons
or by using the 'Section' menu.  IncomeTax only 
demonstrates the user interface portion of an
application and by no mean is it a complete 
application. 

IncomeTax application has a Section menu which
has three menu items.

Label: Label menu item will bring up TaxLabelDialog 
    where the user can enter in name, address and 
    phone number.   When IncomeTax is opened, this
    dialog is opened by default.

Filing: Filing menu item will bring up TaxFilingDialog
    where the user can enter in their filing status.

Income: Income menu item will bring up 
    TaxIncomeDialog where the user can enter in
    their income information.
