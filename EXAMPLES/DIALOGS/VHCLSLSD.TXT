This file contains a brief description of Vehicle 
SalesDialog.  VehicleSalesDialog is an example of a
DialogBox created in Smalltalk (by creating a subclass
of WindowDialog).  It also demonstrates the use of 
the following:

    - Creating a Modal DialogBox.
        (Modal DialogBox disables the parent window).

    - Use of FormattedEntryFields.
        (Name field only accepts alpha characters.
         Date, phone number, social security and
         currency field only accept numbers and their
         output is formated.)

    - Use of FormattedStaticText.
        (currency field's output is formated.)

    - Customizing FormattedEntryFields.
        (Look at how social security entry field is created
            in #buildCustControls.)   

    - Use of GroupBox in a DialogBox.
        (Look at how the GroupBox is created in
            #buildCustControls and #buildVehicleControls.)

    - Use of #textChanged event to trigger an action.
        (The tax and total price is calculated
            automatically when the price of the vehicle
            changes).
