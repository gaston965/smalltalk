TurtleDialog
------------------- 

This file contains a brief description of TurtleDialog.  
TurtleDialog is an example of a DialogBox created
in Smalltalk (by creating a subclass of WindowDialog).
It also demonstrates the use of the following:

    - Creating a DialogBox with a GraphPane 
        (or any other SubPane).

    - Creating a Modeless DialogBox.
       (Modeless DialogBox does not disable the
        parent window).

    - Use of FormattedEntryFields
        (The entry fields in this dialog box only accepts
          Integer values).
