FormattedEntryField
---------------------------------

The FormattedEntryField class validates and formats
the output of entry fields.  Validation is provided at 
two levels.  First level of validation is at key stroke 
level.  Every character entered is checked for validity 
by evaluating the stroke block that was set with 
the #strokeBlock: method.  Next level of validation is 
at the field level.  When a new value is entered for 
the field, (i.e. the user attempts to leave the field), the 
accept block that was set with the #acceptBlock: 
method is evaluated with the new value.  

At the time of field level validation, if the new value is
acceptable, the accept block formats the output also.  

Another level of abstraction is provided by set of 
methods that sets the accept block and stroke block 
to predefined blocks.  These methods are:

    #acceptAlpha
    #acceptDate
    #acceptDollar
    #acceptFloat
    #acceptInteger
    #acceptPhoneNumber
    #acceptPositiveInteger

Named Instance Variables:
    strokeBlock
        Contains a block with one argument.  Every key
        stroke is validated by evaluating this block with
        the character entered as the argument.  If the
        character is accepted the block should return 
        true other wise, false.

    acceptBlock
        Contains a block with one argument.  Every time
        the entry field get a new value, (i.e. the user attempts
        to leave the field), this block is evaluated with the
        new value as the argument.  If the new value is 
        accepted, the block should return the value as
        formated output.  If the new value is not accepted,
        this block should inform the user of the problem 
        and just return the new value.

    formatedOutput
        contains the formated output of the entry field.

    validateAlpha: input withChar: ch position: pos
        Validates whether ch is a acceptable alpha character
            ( $A - $Z, $a - $z or space) in input string at positon
            pos.  Answers true if it is acceptable
            else false.

    validateDollar: input withChar: ch position: pos
        Validates whether ch is a acceptable character for a
            dollar currency in input string at position pos.
            Answers true if it is acceptable
            else false.

    validateFloat: input withChar: ch position: pos
        Validates whether ch is a acceptable character for a
            Float in input string at position pos.
            Answers true if it is acceptable
            else false.

    validateInteger: input withChar: ch position: pos
        Validates whether ch is a acceptable character for a
            Integer in input string at position pos.
            Answers true if it is acceptable
            else false.

    validatePositiveInteger: input withChar: ch position: pos
        Validates whether ch is a acceptable character for a
            Positive Integer in input string at position pos.

Instance Methods:

    acceptAlpha
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept alpha
            characters (A - Z, a- z).

    acceptBlock: aBlock
        Set accept block to aBlock.  When FormattedEntryField
            get a new value, aBlock is evaluated with the new
            value as the argument.  If the new value is accepted,
            aBlock should return the new value as formated output.
            If the new value is not accepted, aBlock should inform
            the user of the problem and just return the new value.

    acceptDate
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept date.
            (6 digit positive integer.)
            The entered value will be shown in date format.

    acceptDollar
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept dollar currency.
            (a floating point number with two decimal places.)
            The entered value will be shown in dollar currency format.

    acceptFloat
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept floating point
            number.

    acceptInteger
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept integer.

    acceptPhoneNumber
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept phone number.
           (either a 7 or 10 digit number.)
            The entered value will be shown in phone number format. 

    acceptPositiveInteger
        Sets the FormattedEntryField to only accept positive integer.

    contents
        Answer a string containing the text of the item.

    contents: input
        Set the String associated with this control.

    formatedOutput
        Answers formated output string of the FormattedEntryField.

    strokeBlock: aBlock
        Set stroke block to aBlock.  For each key stroke entered,
            aBlock is evaluated with a Character as the argument.
            If the character is accepted aBlock should return true,
            other wise it should return false.
