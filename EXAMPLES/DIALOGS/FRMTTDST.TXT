FormattedStaticText
----------------------------

The FormattedStaticText class shows the static
text's value formated.   Before the static text's 
value is shown, it is formated by evaluating the 
accept block that was set with #acceptBlock: 
method.

Another level of abstraction is provided by set of
methods that sets the accept block to predefined 
blocks.  These methods are:

    #formatAsDate
    #formatAsDollar
    #formatAsPhoneNumber

Named Instance Variables:

    acceptBlock
        Contains a block with one argument.  Every time
        the static text gets a new value, (i.e. the value of
        the field gets updated), this block is evaluated 
        with the new value as the argument.  If the new 
        value is accepted, the block should return the 
        value as formated output.  If the new value is 
        not accepted, this block should just return the 
        new value.

    formatedOutput
        contains the formated output of the entry field.

Instance Methods:

    acceptBlock: aBlock
        Set accept block to aBlock.  When FormattedStaticText
            get a new value, aBlock is evaluated with the new
            value as the argument.  If the new value is accepted,
            aBlock should return the new value as formated output.
            If the new value is not accepted, aBlock should 
            just return the new value.
