Dashboard 

The class Dashboard implements a simulated car dashboard 
using dials and gauges.  It is an example of a visual 
simulation and an example of using instances of the 
ControlApparatus classes. 

To file in the Dashboard evaluate the following expression: 

     (File pathName: 'examples\dashbord\dashbord.st') fileIn; close 

To open the dash board, evaluate the following expression: 

     Dashboard new open

To operate the dials and gauges, click the left mouse button 
when the cursor is over the new reading to which you wish to 
set the gauge.  To push a button (change gears), click the 
left mouse button when the cursor is over the button you 
wish to press.  Notice that when you change the reading of 
one dial or gauge, the others react accordingly.  Two of the 
gauges are connected to the system clock (the fuel and temp 
gauges).  To enable or disable the clock, use the clock menu 
of the dash board.  

To see a demonstration of Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE),
open dashboard and then open 'dash.xls' from Microsoft Excel or
open 'dash.doc' from Microsoft Word. When you adjust the dials 
and gauges, the mph, rpm, and oil gauge values
will be updated in these documents.

The following is a brief description of the structure of the 
class DashBoard.

            receiver.  

Scale 

    Scale class is an abstract class.  Subclasses of Scale 
    implement dials or gauges that can be set to any value 
    within a linear range of values 

    Subclasses of Scale must implement the following
