The list below shows the files needed to modify
vwsignon.dll, a signon dialog for Smalltalk.
(Microsoft C 6.0 and Windows SDK is required)

    vwsignon       - make file for vwsignon.dll
    vwsignon.c     - c file for vwsignon.dll that contains WEP
    vwsignon.def   - definition file for vwsignon.dll 
                            (Used by the Linker)
    vwsignon.rc    - resource file for vwsignon.dll 
                            (Used by Resource Compiler)
    vwsignon.dlg   - dialog file for vwsignon.dll 
                            (Used by Dialog Editor)

The Smalltalk sign-on screen is painted by vwsignon.dll, 
when you run 'v.exe'.  You can change this DLL to customize
sign-on screen for your application.  This DLL can be either 
empty (no sign-on screen) or 
supports two functions: 
 
     OpenSignOn (WORD wVersion, HANDLE hInstance) 
and 
     CloseSignOn (void) 
 
When OpenSignOn is called, the current Smalltalk version 
number is passed as a parameter.  You should paint the screen 
or bring up a dialog box.  When CloseSignOn is called, you 
should erase the screen or close the dialog box.
