OVERVIEW
--------
ClassDumper is a tool which dumps a shapshot of the classes in the
current image to a file.  This snapshot file is then used by the
ClassComparisonTool to compare to another image.  For more information
on the ClassComparisonTool, please read the file CLSCOMP.TXT in this
directory.


INSTALLATION
------------
To install the ClassDumper, install (file in) DUMPER.ST in
this directory.


INVOCATION
----------
To begin the dump of the classes in your current image, evaluate the
following expression:

    ClassDumper new startDumping

You will be prompted for a filename in which to store the snapshot;
this will be the 'Snapshot File' which the ClassComparisonTool asks you
for.  You will also be prompted for a descriptive string.  The descriptive 
string is a string you can specify to describe your image.  This can be 
any string, but it is suggested you keep it less than 15 characters.


KNOWN PROBLEMS
--------------
The method ClassCompareSourceString>>strippedOfComments has a bug in it,
where if the method you are looking at has an unpaired quote (i.e. it
has a $" in it somewhere), the resulting string will be incorrect.
