# Standard Windows make file.  The utility MAKE.EXE compares the
# creation date of the file to the left of the colon with the file(s)
# to the right of the colon.  If the file(s) on the right are newer
# then the file on the left, Make will execute all of the command lines
# following this line that are indented by at least one tab or space.
# Any valid MS-DOS command line may be used.

# This line allows NMAKE to work as well
