In previous versions of Smalltalk/V Windows, 
several error message strings were buried in the
Smalltalk virtual machine, VWVMxx.DLL, and
therefore impossible for a programmer to 
change. In VW 2.0, these strings are now
changeable.  To do this, create a DLL with
string resources in it as defined in the VWMSGS 
files in this directory.  Lets say you named
this DLL MYAPP.DLL then when you run Smalltalk 
application include the command line option
/LANG MYAPP.DLL. Smalltalk will use the strings 
in this DLL instead of the hardwired english 
strings in VWVM20.DLL.

To build VWMSGS.DLL, make VWMSGS.  To build
your own DLL copy and rename all the VWMSGS
files, edit VWMSGS.RC, VWMSGS, and VWMSGS.DEF.
